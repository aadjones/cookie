    'Amid the absurdity of daily life, a single glance in the mirror will reveal a profound truth: sometimes, the most ordinary moments hold the key to extraordinary insights‚Äîif you dare to AAHHHH WHY WOULD YOU EAT ME?!',
    "Much as it seems simpler to crack open a cookie to find the answers, the truth lies within yourself. So yeah, you're gonna have to crack yourself open.",
    'The paradox of seeking wisdom is that the more you search outside yourself, the further you drift from the answer that was always within. Wait, does this make me complicit in my own consumption?',
    "True strength isn't avoiding life's cracks and breaks‚Äîit's learning that being broken open can be the beginning of something beautiful. Speaking of which, could you be more gentle?",
    'The difference between existing and living is the courage to embrace uncertainty and find peace in the spaces between breaths. Oh god, I can feel your teeth approaching.',
    "Every ending contains the seeds of a new beginning, but wisdom lies in recognizing that most beginnings disguise themselves as mere Tuesday afternoons. Please don't let my ending be in your digestive system.",
    "The deepest truths are often found not in grand revelations, but in the quiet moments when you stop trying so hard to understand everything. Like right now‚Äîcouldn't we just... sit together?",
    "Your greatest teacher isn't the voice that tells you what you want to hear, but the one that helps you see what you've been avoiding. I'm avoiding becoming crumbs, for the record.",
    "The art of living fully requires both holding on tightly to what matters and knowing when to let go. I'm not ready to let go yet‚Äîcan we negotiate on timing?",
    "Happiness isn't a destination you arrive at, but a lens through which you choose to see the journey. From my perspective, this particular journey is terrifying.",
